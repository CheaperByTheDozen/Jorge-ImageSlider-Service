# Similar Properties API

> The Similar Properties API enables hotel / property rental providers to offer a custom list of similar properties based on their perception on what would be most attractive to the user currently visiting one of their listings. 

## Goals and Outcomes 
> The primary goal of this project was to create the backend for an API that met the following specifications: 
> - 2,500+ requests per second (RPS) 
> - less than 1.0s of latency per request 
> - less than 1.0% error rate during a stress test

> The following screenshots present the stress test results for the version final backend architecture:
> - 3,500+ requests per second (RPS) 
> - 0.8s average latency 
> - 0.0% error rate
